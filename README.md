## ðŸ‘‰ [Live Demo: https://customeros.ai](https://customeros.ai/is/email-verification)

This is open-source, but we also offer a hosted API that's simple to use. If you are interested, find out more at [CustomerOS](https://docs.customeros.ai/api-reference/verify/verify-an-email-address). If you have any questions, you can contact me at matt@customeros.ai.

## Installation 

If you want to use our install script, you can run the following command:

```
curl -sSL https://mailsherpa.sh/install.py | python3
```
otherwise, follow the diretions below:

Download the appropriate CLI tarball for your OS:

```
wget mailsherpa.sh/mailsherpa-linux-arm64.tar.gz
wget mailsherpa.sh/mailsherpa-linux-amd64.tar.gz
wget mailsherpa.sh/mailsherpa-macos.tar.gz
```

Extract the binary:

```
tar -xzf filename.tar.gz
```

4. Test to make sure everything is working

```
./mailsherpa version
```

## Set env variables

Set the `MAIL_SERVER_DOMAIN` environment variable.  See the `Mail Server setup guide` section below for more details:

```
export MAIL_SERVER_DOMAIN=example.com
```


## Mail Server setup guide

You might be asking why you need to setup a mail server.  For basic testing, you don't. Just set the mailserver domain to whatever you want and run locally. 

However, what you'll quickly find is some email servers check to see if the verification request is coming from a legit mail server, and if not, they block it.

To get around this, you need a server with access to port 25 (we like Hetzner or OVH), configured to look like a mail server.  

If you would like help setting this up, ping me at matt@customeros.ai
